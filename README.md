# IBRD Data Analysis Project.
Welcome to the __IBRD Data Analysis Project__.  

This project will be of interest to people who want to understand the work of the ___"International Bank for Reconstruction and Development"___ ([IBRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development)) and find some answers by analyzing data on loans and grants issued.

# Business Questions:
* What is the volume of loans and grants issued, as well as their ratio?
* Which countries were given these loans and what volume?
* How much funds are provided and how much of these funds are used?
* Are loans repaid on time?
* Which countries are issued loans more often?
* What interest were loans issued and what volume?
* I think we will be able to discover much more during the analysis!)

 
## IBRD Statement of Loans (data)
The analysis was based on information taken from the [official website](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IBRD-Statement-of-Loans-Latest-Available-Snapshot/sfv5-tf7p) and Updated (___January 10, 2022___)  
[Data_Dictionary](Data_Dictionary_-_IBRD_Statement_of_Loans_and_IDA_Statement_of_Credits_and_Grants.pdf) in the attachment.

To get answers with this database, I will use queries using MySQL. 
And to demonstrate the results of Tableau ([Dashboard IBRD](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mykhailo2589/viz/DashboardIBRDStatementofLoansandIDAStatement/DashboardIBRD?publish=yes)).  
The main points of the process of finding answers will be documented and you can, if you wish, recreate them for yourself.
