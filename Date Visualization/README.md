# IBRD Data Analysis Project.
Welcome to the __IBRD Data Analysis Project__.  

This project will be of interest to people who want to understand the work of the ___"International Bank for Reconstruction and Development"___ ([IBRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development)) and find some answers by analyzing data on loans and grants issued.

# Business Questions:
* What is the volume of loans and grants issued, as well as their ratio?
* Which countries were given these loans and in what volume?
* How much funds are provided and how much of these funds are used?
* Are loans repaid on time?
* Which countries are issued loans more often?
* At what interest were loans issued and in what volume?
* I think we will be able to discover a lot more during the analysis!)

 
## IBRD Statement of Loans (data)
The analysis was based on information taken from the [official website](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IBRD-Statement-of-Loans-Latest-Available-Snapshot/sfv5-tf7p) and Updated (___January 10, 2022___)  
[Data_Dictionary](Data_Dictionary_-_IBRD_Statement_of_Loans_and_IDA_Statement_of_Credits_and_Grants.pdf) in the attachment.

To get answers with this database, I will use queries using MySQL. And to demonstrate the results of Tableau (interactive dashboards).  
The main points of the process of finding answers will be documented and you can, if you wish, recreate them for yourself or tell me how to do it better!)

# Base on my dataset I create that date visualization.
